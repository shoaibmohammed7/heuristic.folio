In this project, we crawled data from Reddit, created a social network based on the comments made by users, and analyzed the network using several network measures. The results of the analysis showed that the network has a few users with a very high degree, but most users are not well-connected to their neighbours. There are also a few nodes that are very central to the network, indicaDng that they may be important "bridges" between different parts of the network.
